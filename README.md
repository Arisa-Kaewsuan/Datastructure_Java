## What is Data Structure ?
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize ,arranging ,accessed and updated data.
### ‚ö°Ô∏è Examples of data structures that can be seen in the real world :
> [ Array ]--[ Linked List ]--[ Stack ]--[ Queue ]--[ Binary Tree ]--[ Binary Search Tree ]--[ Heap ]--[ Hashing ]--[ Graph ] and more . . .

## Why Learn Data Structure ?
- Data structure and algorithms are two of the most important aspects of computer science 
- Learning data structure and algorithms will help you become a better programmer because . . . 
  1. ) You will be able to write code that is more efficient(fast & lightweight) and more reliable (failure-free operation) 
       > You can become a better programmer because the data structure make you know which data structure is write fast or which is read fast . . .
       
       > It is because in reality there is no Which data structure is both write fast ,read fast ,search fast ,etc... so ,duties of a good programmer is to choose to use appropriately, making the program fast and lightweight.
  2. ) You will also be able to solve problems more quickly by using " BigO " to tell that algorithm is faster ?
       > **What is BigO Notation ? :** 
       
       > Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm by using the mathematical relationship of " Operation (is code execution time) " and " Elements (is size of input) ".
